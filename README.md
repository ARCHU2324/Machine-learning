Linear Regression from scratch and visualization

At the outset, I created a linear regression function from scratch using Python's object-oriented programming (OOP) concept. This function takes in input variables x and y, and calculates the error and learning parameter using a fixed value of 0.001. When provided with data, the function provides the output based on the input points.

Additionally, the repository includes a 1D visualization of the linear regression function's output, plotted using the matplotlib library. For 3D plots, the mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D module is utilized.

Overall, this repository demonstrates a basic implementation of linear regression in Python, with a focus on understanding the core concepts behind the function's calculations and visualizing the results in a simple and intuitive manner.
